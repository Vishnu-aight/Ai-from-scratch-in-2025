# AI From Scratch - 2025

This repository documents my journey of learning Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning from the ground up, starting in 2025. My goal is to build a deep, fundamental understanding of these concepts by implementing them from scratch.

## Projects & Milestones

1.  **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Local LLMs**
    * Developed a full RAG pipeline using Python and Ollama to run large language models entirely on my local machine, enabling powerful AI functionality without API costs.

2.  **Linear Regression (Single Feature)**
    * Implemented a simple linear regression model from scratch using only NumPy, as part of the Andrew Ng Machine Learning Specialization.
    * This project focused on the core mechanics of the cost function and gradient descent for a single variable.

3.  **Multivariate Linear Regression**
    * Extended the single-feature model to handle multiple features. This project was a deep dive into vectorization, matrix multiplication (`np.dot`), the importance of the transpose (`.T`), and object-oriented design.

## Key Concepts I'm Learning
* Gradient Descent
* Cost Functions
* Vectorization & Matrix Operations (NumPy)
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for ML Models
* The importance of Feature Scaling & Learning Rate Tuning
* Large Language Model (LLM) Pipelines (RAG)

## Attribution

A significant portion of my foundational knowledge in this repository is guided by the excellent **Machine Learning Specialization** on Coursera by Andrew Ng (DeepLearning.AI / Stanford). All credit for the problem statements and core concepts goes to the course creators.
